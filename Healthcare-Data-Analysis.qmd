# Morbidity and Mortality

### Question 1.

#### What are the top 3 causes of morbidity (illness) and the top 3 causes of mortality (death) in the US?

Top 3 health problems in America are;\
i) heart disease,\
ii) cancer, and. iii) stroke. (Raghupathi, 2018).

In the meantime, top 3 highest number of death were;\
i) heart disease\
ii) cancer, and iii) COVID-19.
(https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm).

#### Question 1-1.

#### In the Synthea data set, how would you estimate similar answers?

##### Finding Top 3 Illnesses in Synthea Databse

According to this finding, the top 3 illness in the Synthea database
were; Viral sinusitis, acute viral pharyngitis, and acute bronchitis,
respectively.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT description, COUNT(description) AS cases
FROM conditions
WHERE description LIKE '%disorder%' /*in order to filter disorder from description*/ 
GROUP BY description
ORDER BY COUNT(description) DESC 
LIMIT 3 /* to show only top 3 disorders*/

```

##### Finding Top 3 Causes of Deaths in Synthea Databse

According to this finding, the top 3 cause of death in the Synthea
database were; end-stage renal disease, chronic congestive heart
failure, and acute myocardial infarction.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT value, COUNT(value) AS cases
FROM observations
WHERE code='69453-9'
GROUP BY value /* to enable aggregate function (COUNT) */
ORDER BY COUNT(value) DESC /* to show highest number of cases on top*/ 
LIMIT 3
```

# Insurance

### Question 2.

#### What is the breakdown of spending between Medicaid, Medicare and everything else in the US? Why do you think it might break down this way?

1.  According to the National Health Expenditure Data from
    [CMS.gov](https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/national-health-expenditure-data/nhe-fact-sheet#:~:text=Medicare%20spending%20grew%208.4%25%20to,28%20percent%20of%20total%20NHE.),
    the total healthcare spending in the US has been increasing. The
    following table represents the result of this data, with the dollar
    unit of billion US dollars.\
2.  When focusing on the year 2021 alone, it can be seen that the growth
    in Medicaid was higher than Medicare, which according to the
    'National Health Expenditures 2021 Highlights report', was due to
    the enrollment requirement of the Families First Coronavirus
    Response Act of 2020.\
3.  Another abnormal trend that can be observed is in year 2020, where
    private health insurance spending actually decreased from the year
    before. It could be because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the drop
    of employer-sponsored insurance.

```{r}
library("readxl")
data<-read_excel("National Health Expenditures.xlsx", col_names = TRUE, skip=2 ) #Imported National Health Expenditures data in Excel form 


sorted<-data[c(2,24,49,71,96,118,143,165),c(1:11)] # Selected rows showing the total amount

year<-c('2014','2015','2016','2017','2018','2019','2020','2021')
sorted_update<-cbind(sorted,year) # Added year as reference row
answer<-sorted_update[,c(12,6,7,5,8,9)]
cols_num<-c("Medicare","Medicaid","Private Health Insurance","Other Health Insurance Programs1", "Other Third Party Payers2")
answer[cols_num]<-sapply(answer[cols_num], as.numeric) # Changed data type so that values have the same numeric data type. 
answer

```

### Question 2-1.

#### In the Synthea data set, how would you estimate similar answers?

###### Following is the SQL query and sorted total cost acording to payer.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT p.name, date_part('year', start) AS year, SUM(e.total_claim_cost) AS total_cost 
FROM encounters AS E
INNER JOIN
payers AS p
ON e.payer=p.id
WHERE date_part('year', start)=2022
GROUP BY year, p.name
ORDER BY total_cost DESC

```

# Lack of Insurance

### Question 3.

#### What percent of Americans are estimated to be uninsured in the United States? How has this changed over the past 15 years, and why?

Following is the uninsured population ratio (non-elderly) from year 2010
to year 2020. ![Uninsured population ratio](uninsured.png) There was a
substantial decrease in uninsured population ratio in year 2014, with
the implementation of several provisions of Affordable Care Act,
according to ASPE (Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation)
Issue Brief issued in February 11,2021.

Following image is the uninsured population trend from year 1987 to year
2010. When looking into the range from year 2005 to 2010, the uninsured
rate has gradually increased.

![uninsured_past](uninsured_past.png)

#### Question 3-1.

##### In the Synthea data set, how would you estimate similar answers?

-   As per the following filtering process, the ratio of no-insurance
    patient population from Synthea database was approximately 6%, with
    slight decrease during the past years.

```{sql connection=con}
WITH yeardata AS /* table with year data */
(
SELECT pt.patient , date_part('year',pt.start_date) AS startdate, p.name
FROM payer_transitions AS pt
INNER JOIN
payers AS p
ON pt.payer=p.id
),
yearnoinsurance AS /*second table with "no_insurance" case included */
(
SELECT startdate, CAST(COUNT(patient) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS countall, CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN name='NO_INSURANCE' THEN patient END) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS noinsurance 
FROM yeardata
GROUP BY startdate
) /* table with overall patient & patient with no insurance*/

SELECT startdate, noinsurance, countall, CAST(((noinsurance*100)/countall) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS ratio 
FROM yearnoinsurance 
ORDER BY startdate DESC
LIMIT 15

```

# Surprise Billing

### Question 4.

##### What is meant by "surprise billing" in the US?

-   A 'surprise medical bill' is an unexpected bill from an
    out-of-network provider or an out-of-network facility. The patient
    may not know at the time of service that was out-of-network, and
    only be aware after the patient was billed. (reference:
    [consumerfinance.gov](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-a-surprise-medical-bill-and-what-should-i-know-about-the-no-surprises-act-en-2123/))

##### How would you find evidence of this in the Synthea data set? Show whether it exists or does not exist in Synthea.

-   According to the following query, encounter 'start' column was used
    as a reference to compare with payer_transitions start_date and
    end_date. There were 638 rows, indicating that in 638 cases,
    patients were categorized as no-insurance, when they actually had
    insurance. However, when looking into details, the encounter start
    date and time are identical to the payer_transitions end_date date
    and time. In order to examine this unusual result, encounter 'stop'
    date and time were referenced in the next SQL query for comparison.

```{sql connection=con}
WITH noinsurance AS
(
SELECT p.name, e.patient, e.start, e.payer
FROM encounters AS e
INNER JOIN
payers AS p
ON p.id=e.payer
WHERE p.name='NO_INSURANCE'
), /*filtered patients from encounters table where encounters used no-insurance*/
combined AS 
(
SELECT i.name, i.patient, i.start, pt.start_date, pt.end_date, pt.payer
FROM noinsurance AS i
INNER JOIN
payer_transitions AS pt
ON i.patient=pt.patient
WHERE i.start BETWEEN pt.start_date AND pt.end_date
) /* selected no-insurance encounters and joined with according time period from payer_transitions table */

SELECT c.patient, c.name, p.name, c.start AS encounter, c.start_date AS insurance_start, c.end_date AS insurance_end
FROM combined AS c
INNER JOIN 
payers AS p
ON c.payer=p.id
WHERE p.name != 'NO_INSURANCE' /* filtered cases where the payer name was not no_insurance, meaning that the patient had an insurance at the time of encounter */

```

In the following analysis, there seems to be 27 cases of 'surprise
billing'. The encounter 'stop' date and time were not identical with
either payer_transitions start or end date. However, the encounter
'stop' date and time were substantially close (within 24 hours) from the
payer_transitions start date and time. These results indicate that
further analysis may be necessary for these inconsistency.

```{sql connection=con}

WITH tableone AS
(
SELECT p.name AS noinsurance, e.patient AS patient, e.stop AS encounterdate, e.payer AS payerid
FROM encounters AS e
INNER JOIN
payers AS p
ON p.id=e.payer
WHERE p.name='NO_INSURANCE'
), 
tabletwo AS
(
SELECT t.noinsurance, t.patient, t.encounterdate, pt.start_date, pt.end_date, pt.payer
FROM tableone AS t
INNER JOIN
payer_transitions AS pt
ON t.patient=pt.patient
WHERE t.encounterdate BETWEEN pt.start_date AND pt.end_date
)
SELECT tt.patient, tt.noinsurance, p.name, tt.encounterdate, tt.start_date AS insurance_start, tt.end_date AS insurance_end
FROM tabletwo AS tt
INNER JOIN 
payers AS p
ON tt.payer=p.id
WHERE p.name != 'NO_INSURANCE'
```
